Class defining container of spectra must implement Evel.interfaces.ISpectraContainer.
New container class may inherit from Evel.engine.SpectraContainerBase
There is SpectraContainerBase class designed which already implements this interface. However some of its 
methods throws NotImplementedException so designed of new container class is obliged to override them.
There are also constructors which must be also declared in new container class. 
Here you can find minimum set of methods which must be implemented


        public constructor(IProject parentProject, IModel model)
            : base(parentProject, model) {
            ...
        }

        public constructor(IProject parentProject, string name, IModel model, string[] spectraPaths, ICollection<GroupDefinition> groupsDefinition)
            : base(parentProject, name, model, spectraPaths, groupsDefinition) {
            ...
        }
      
        public constructor(IProject parentProject, string filePath)
            : base(parentProject, filePath) {
            ...
        }

        public virtual double[] getTheoreticalSpectrum(ISpectrum spectrum) {
            ...
        }

        public virtual void getEvaluationArray(object target, double[] diffs) {
            ...
        }

        public virtual void getTheoreticalSpectrum(ISpectrum spectrum, ref double[] theoreticalCurve, ref double[] differences, bool intensitiesFromSearch) {
            ...
        }

        public virtual ISpectrum CreateSpectrum(System.Xml.XmlReader spectrumReader) {
            ...
        }
